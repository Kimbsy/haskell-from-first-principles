# haskell-from-first-principles

Using a basic stack project here to go through the exercises and examples in the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](https://haskellbook.com/).

# Usage:

Either:
- Run a shell with `C-x, M-m`
- Run ghci with `stack ghci`

Or:
- Run interactive Haskell REPL with `M-x, haskell-interactive-bring, RET`

Then:
- Load a file with `:l src/foo.hs`
- Get the type of an expression with `:t <expression>`
- Get info about a function with `:i <func>` or `:i (<infix-operator>)`
